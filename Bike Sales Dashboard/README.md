# Bike Sales Dashboard


## Problem Statements and Overview

A bike company is worried about it declining sales in many regions that are under operations. They asked regional managers to look after the matter but you know what they did, they simply passed on the excel sheet of raw data to the headquarter. They said that everything is fine by their side, now this is really annoying for a company. So, I as a data analyst stepped into the matter and analysed different perspective of the sales and its reasons for decline.

## Tool used
#### MS Excel - to store and view raw data, clean it, make interesting pivot table and finally transform it into a Dashboard.


## Dashboard Process

#### Note : The first three steps is of Pivot Table.

1. Analysis of average income vs bike purchase to understand the purchasing parity.

4. Finally converting these findings to an appealing dashboard. Added many filters like the education, marital status and regions of the customer to better understand the trends.

## Challenges and consideration
1. Data formatting on marital status and gender column.

2. Created a new column named "Age Bracket" to provide better filter option.

3. Creating three Pivot Table with correct choice of data to provide valuable insights.

4. Adding filter option so that company can see whatever numbers they are interested in.

5. Finally placing each and every components in a correct order and choosing mindful colors for a good demonstration.
